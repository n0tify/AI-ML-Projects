🌸 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification - Iris Dataset 🌸
📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm using the famous Iris flower classification dataset.

The goal is to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica based on their petal and sepal dimensions.

✅ Project Workflow
Step	Description
1. Data Loading & Exploration	Loaded the Iris dataset and explored its structure
2. Data Preprocessing	Encoded target labels, normalized features
3. Model Training (KNN Classifier)	Trained the model with different K values and evaluated performance
4. Error Rate vs K Analysis	Plotted error rate across a range of K values to find the best K
5. Final Model & Evaluation	Trained the best KNN model and evaluated accuracy and classification report
6. Confusion Matrix & Decision Boundary Visualization	Visualized confusion matrix and decision boundaries
---
📊 Visualizations
✅ 1. Error Rate vs K Value
Shows how test error changes with different values of K.

✅ 2. Confusion Matrix
Displays the model's classification performance.

✅ 3. Decision Boundary Visualization
Visualizes how KNN separates different classes (for 2D feature space).

✅ Model Performance
Best K selected: (Based on error rate analysis)

Final Accuracy: ~1.00 ✅ (on this small, clean dataset)

⚠️ Note:
Since the Iris dataset is small and noise-free, KNN performs with very high accuracy here.
For real-world datasets with noise and more complexity, KNN might need tuning, better normalization, and larger K values.
